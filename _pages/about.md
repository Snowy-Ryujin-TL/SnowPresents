Synposis
======
This is a winter-themed variety pack for Kono Oozora ni, Tsubasa o Hirogete, including a mini FD for main heroine Kotori, as well a drama CD of the Soaring Club’s winter camp, a soundtrack with Kotori’s character song and some digital contents, such as binaural system voices and wallpapers. The mini FD focuses on Kotori’s sweet cohabitation with Aoi following her leg surgery and rehab. It’s written in a diary format and features lots of ichaicha and ecchi.

(From Hau~ Omochikaeri!)

Some things to note...
======
- This patch has been tested on the DISC RELEASE only, however the DOWNLOAD RELEASE should be compatible.
- ***The current version of the patch must be ran in Japanese locale.*** See below for more info.
- v1.0 and v1.01 have an issue with the font we packed in, including crashes and the font not loading, particularly when the computer is in a non-JP locale and the game is run in Locale Emulator. Running without our font will show word wrapping issues. We aim to have this fixed in v1.1.
