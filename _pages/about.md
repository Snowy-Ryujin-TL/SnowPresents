Synposis
======
This is a winter-themed variety pack for Kono Oozora ni, Tsubasa o Hirogete, including a mini FD for main heroine Kotori, as well a drama CD of the Soaring Club’s winter camp, a soundtrack with Kotori’s character song and some digital contents, such as binaural system voices and wallpapers. The mini FD focuses on Kotori’s sweet cohabitation with Aoi following her leg surgery and rehab. It’s written in a diary format and features lots of ichaicha and ecchi.

(From Hau~ Omochikaeri!)

Some things to note...
======
- This patch has been tested on the DISC RELEASE only, however the DOWNLOAD RELEASE should be compatible.
- You ***do not*** need to set your computer to Japanese locale and region formatting. Running via `AdvHDENG.exe` should allow you to proceed without having to change any settings. (Our patch implements the Locale Emulator program by xupefei via the Universal Injector Framework by AtomCrafty.)
